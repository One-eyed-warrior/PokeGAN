This is a WIP code on implementing Deep Convolutional GAN Architecture on the [Pokemon Dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset/data))

This fun little endeavour of mine is essentially built upon concepts from [Radford et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) 

Currently I am not getting clear results (hence why its WIP), Hopefully after some fine-tuning I can get it up and running. 

Also facing issues with computation power (oh well). Hopefully all will be resolved soon.

[UPDATE] 24/4/24: Alright, I changed the architecture for the generator a bit and it looks more coherent now, although I suspect I definitely need more epochs
